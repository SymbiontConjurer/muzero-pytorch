- Update gym to gymnasium
- Generate videos every N episodes
- Generate new results directories
- Save videos and artifacts to WandB
- Save old checkpoints so I can compare them
- Easier way to iterate on experiments without code changes
  (e.g., config yaml files, ability to run a spread of experiments automatically)
